Let us start with an update on our collaboration with Microsoft: This is so far working great! We have by now modified our solution such that our as well the Microsoft flavor of the adapter can be built, laying the path for future work (most of this work has been done by Microsoft's [Lukasz Mendakiewisz](https://github.com/LukaszMendakiewicz) who has done a great job - thanks, Lukasz!).

Now for the changes contained in this version:
* enhancement: many changes by Microsoft have already been merged into GTA - thanks, Microsoft!
  * the GTA toolbar has new (and more appropriate) icons
  * test discovery has been slightly accelerated
  * the origin of test executables is verified before running them - if they have not been created on the local machine, they will be ignored with a warning
  * settings files are now validated against an XML schema
  * dependencies on 3rd party libraries have been reduced
* bugfix: under very special circumstances, test executables containing spaces in their paths could not be run ([TAFGT #18](https://github.com/Microsoft/TestAdapterForGoogleTest/issues/18), thanks to [Lukasz](https://github.com/LukaszMendakiewicz) for fix)
